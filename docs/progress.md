# Current Project State

## Objective

Turn local operational spreadsheets into validated analytical datasets and an approved ERP model, then let users ask governed analytical questions without requiring SQL knowledge.

## Current Stage

Three active tracks: Product Stage 3E.6 is `ready_for_canonical_state_review` with no canonical apply; AI analytics Stage 5C has technical validation plus explicit human review/application contracts but no approved real catalog; and benchmark onboarding remains pending dataset export/review and approval.

## Last Completed Milestone

On 2026-07-14, Stage 5C added hash-bound human semantic review and explicit dry-run/application contracts. Every entity and ambiguity requires a complete human decision and note; stale, rejected, pending, missing, duplicate, or malformed decisions fail closed. State application is idempotent and protected against silent replacement. No real semantic catalog was reviewed or approved.

## Current Capabilities

- Convert and normalize local CSV/XLSX inputs.
- Profile, clean, infer schemas/keys, and validate relationships.
- Generate SQL suggestions, DuckDB datasets, Tableau exports, and data dictionaries.
- Onboard ERP sources and keep generated model candidates pending review.
- Import serial reference rules and prepare human approval packages.
- Reconcile Product references, validate staged human decisions, and persist explicitly approved Product reconciliation state.
- Produce a clean, validated Product review workbook and a revalidated Step 3E.4 application plan.
- Apply Product reconciliation state only through an explicit, idempotent, reversible command.
- Validate applied Product state and build deterministic local Product preview, lineage, exclusion, manifest, and blocker artifacts.
- Validate a complete Product snapshot against applied state and produce a hash-bound dry-run canonical promotion plan.
- Fail closed without a partial preview when approved decisions lack materializable source evidence.
- Replace an applied Product decision set only with explicit authority while preserving the prior state in versioned history.
- Generate conceptual schema and business-flow documentation.
- Compile bounded structured analytical requests against a local DuckDB catalog without executing SQL.
- Reject raw SQL, unapproved joins, unknown schema references, unsafe limits, and malformed relationship registries.
- Execute an exact reviewed structured plan against local DuckDB with read-only, timeout, memory, thread, temporary-storage, row, and byte controls.
- Produce hash-bound result CSV, manifest control totals, blockers, and explicit no-row diagnostics without partial output on failure or divergent overwrite.
- Validate candidate dataset/table names, synonyms, dimensions, measures, and relationship paths against live DuckDB metadata and approved relationships.
- Resolve normalized business terms as unique, ambiguous, unknown, or catalog-blocked without silently selecting a candidate.
- Prepare a pending human semantic review bound to the exact compiled catalog by SHA-256.
- Validate complete semantic decisions in dry-run mode and apply a minimal approved registry only with explicit authority.
- Preserve ambiguity for clarification or record one exact human-selected target without promoting candidate relationships.
- Inventory local benchmark sources with hashes, provenance/license status, and separate use approvals.
- Convert supported T-SQL samples to deterministic DuckDB/Parquet artifacts while ignoring operational SQL and retaining foreign keys as pending candidates.
- Restore and integrity-check the official AdventureWorks 2025 backup in an isolated local read-only SQL Server database.

## Test Status

- Automated suite: 78 tests passed offline on 2026-07-14; latest run completed in 8.97 seconds.
- All 12 project-local skills passed the official skill validator on 2026-07-13.
- Internal link check: 26 checked, 0 broken on 2026-07-14.
- Main suite is offline and uses temporary directories for generated test artifacts.
- Documentation link checker is available at `scripts/check_internal_links.py`.
- The relocated `.venv` has a stale editable-install path; use the `PYTHONPATH=src` command in `docs/testing.md` until environment repair is explicitly approved.
- The relocated `.venv\Scripts\dataops.exe` launcher exits unsuccessfully because it still embeds the previous environment location; use `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m data_ops_lab` with `PYTHONPATH=src`.

## Open Risks

- Reports under `outputs/originaldatabase_analysis/` are stale and still show earlier Product blockers; use the 2026-07-14 resolved materialization report under `outputs/019f21a4-daf0-7272-b2a7-09b4f0e2c75b/step3e5_product_materialization_resolved/`.
- `canonical_tables.yml` still describes the pre-application Product key candidate; downstream work must treat `product_reconciliation_state.yml` as the approved Product-specific contract until those representations are deliberately reconciled.
- `ready_for_canonical_state_review` is dry-run evidence only; it is not approval to apply a Product snapshot or change `canonical_tables.yml`.
- Organisation business-key selection and several document-flow relationships still need business context.
- Conflicted line extracts must not be promoted to approved relationships.
- The current orchestrator does not yet expose module discovery, dependency resolution, checkpoints, resume, or dry-run as shared infrastructure.
- Several core pipeline stages still load whole Parquet tables into Pandas; larger-than-memory operation requires DuckDB pushdown and streaming refactors.
- No concrete semantic catalog has completed human review or been applied; the new contract alone does not authorize Stage 5D or any dataset use.
- The natural-language adapter, result narration/validation, and benchmark question/answer harness are not implemented yet.
- Plan-to-execution database drift uses size and nanosecond modification time rather than a full database content hash; immutable dataset-package identity remains future evidence work.
- Exact download provenance and licensing remain unconfirmed for Northwind, Pubs, and Contoso; local conversion or restoration is not benchmark, training, publication, or upload approval.
- AdventureWorks now has a compatible local restore runtime, but the SQL Server-to-DuckDB/Parquet export is not implemented; the Contoso recipe references external data and was not executed.
- A second SQL Server 2025 Evaluation instance (`DATAOPSLAB`) remains installed but stopped; project work should use the default Developer instance only when an explicitly authorized restore/export task requires it.

## Active Blockers

- `config/data_model/approved_keys.yml` and `config/data_model/approved_relationships.yml` remain empty by design.
- Broader canonical key and relationship approvals remain pending; the Product-specific state does not populate `approved_keys.yml` or `approved_relationships.yml`.
- No explicit apply contract or approved versioned representation exists yet for the candidate canonical Product snapshot.
- EDS cross-table analytics remain blocked because `approved_relationships.yml` is intentionally empty.
- No applied `config/analytics/approved_semantic_catalog.yml` exists for a real authorized dataset.
- Northwind and Pubs are converted but remain pending provenance, license, schema, relationship, and benchmark-use approval.
- AdventureWorks is restored and validated but remains pending reproducible export, schema review, relationship approval, and benchmark-use approval.

## Next Logical Milestone

Define the Stage 5D natural-language adapter contract with synthetic fixtures. Require an explicitly approved semantic registry, emit only the existing structured request format, preserve clarification states, and reject raw model SQL. Keep model API integration, Product canonical apply, AdventureWorks export/review, benchmark approval, and EDS execution separate. In parallel, profile the highest-memory Pandas stages before selecting one measured DuckDB pushdown refactor.
